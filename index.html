  <img src="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peking-duck-recipe-11-1.jpg" width="45%">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>A delishous dish from Beijing. It's made of thin, crispy skin and tender duck. Its often served with thin pancakes and a savory sauce.  </p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Whole duck (about 2.5kg/5.5lb)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon fine salt</li>
  <h4>Syrup:</h4>
    <li>2 tablespoon maltose </li>
    <li>1/2 cup of hot water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
  <h4>For the stuffing</h4>
    <li>2 stalks scallions</li>
    <li>1 head garlic</li>
    <li>2 apples - quartered</li>
    <li>4 star anise</li>
    <li>4 bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 pieces cassia cinnamon</li>
  <h4>For the sauce</h4>
    <li>3 tablespoon sweet bean sauce (Tian Mian Jiang/甜面酱)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
  <h4>You also need</h4>
    <li>Peking duck pancakes</li>
    <li>Scallions - <span style="color: grey;">julienned</span></li>
    <li>Cucumber - <span style="color: grey;">peeled and seeds removed, cut into sticks</span></li>







  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  <h4>Prepare the duck</h4>
    <li>Pat dry the duck with kitchen paper then rub the salt over the skin and the cavity. Put the duck over a wire rack with a tray underneath to collect any drips. Leave to rest on the counter for 1 hour.</li>
    
    <li> Bring about 1½ litres of water (about 6 cups) to a boil, then gently pour it over the entire duck skin (remember to flip over and do the other side). You can use a deep tray to collect the water, or do it inside a sink. If there are feather ends on the skin, remove them with a tweezer.</li>

    <li> In a bowl, mix maltose with hot water and vinegar until completely dissolved. Brush a layer of the mixture over the duck skin. Leave to rest in the fridge for 1 hour then brush another layer. 
</li>
    <li>Keep the duck refrigerated uncovered (over the rack and inside a tray) for 24 to 48 hours.
 </li>

<h4>Roast the duck</h4>
    <li>One hour before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge to bring it back to room temperature. Put all the stuffing ingredients (scallions, garlic, apples, star anise, cassia cinnamon and bay leaves) into the cavity. Use toothpicks or skewers to seal the openings of the cavity.
 </li>
    <li> Preheat a fan-assisted oven, aka convection oven, at 200°C/390°F (or 220°C/425°F if using a conventional oven). Put the duck over the middle rack of the oven with the breast side facing up. Place a roasting tray at the bottom of the oven to collect any dripping fat during roasting. Leave to cook for 15 minutes.
</li>
    <li>Then lower the temperature to 180°C/350°F (or 200°C/390°F if using a conventional oven). Use aluminium foil to cover the tip of the wings and the end of the legs. Continue cooking for a further 60 minutes or so (see note 4)
 </li>
 <li>Check the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the duck (the inner thigh area near the breast). The temperature should be no lower than 74C°/165F°.
</li>
<h4>Serve the duck</h4>
 <li>Take the duck out of the oven and leave it to rest for 15 minutes.
</li>
 <li>While waiting, prepare the sauce. Add ½ tablespoon of duck fat collected during roasting to a pan. Add sweet bean sauce and sugar. Mix and simmer over low heat until tiny bubbles appear. Transfer to a small serving dish. Whisk to fully incorporate the sauce and oil.
</li>
 <li>Steam the pancakes for 3 minutes to warm up if they’re cold. Slice the duck into pieces.
</li>
 <li>When eating, spread a little sauce over a pancake, put the duck, scallions and cucumber in the middle. Wrap up into a cylinder and enjoy.
</li>
  </ol>

  <img src="https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2018/05/Kung-Pao-Chicken-16-1660x2048.jpg" width="40%px">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> A stir-fried chicken dish with cubed chicken and rice. The delicious dish has a spicy chili-pepper kick whilst also having sweet and savory chicken. </p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <h4>For the Marinade</h4>
    <li>1½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons corn starch</li>
    <li>1½ lbs chicken tenderloins (or boneless skinless chicken breasts), cut into 1-in pieces</li>
  <4>For the Suace</4>
    <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce, best quality such as Kikkoman or Lee Kum Kee</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1½ tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon corn starch</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (use half the amount for a milder sauce)</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>⅓ cup water</li>
  <h4>For the Stir-fry</h4>
    <li>2½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>2 stalks celery, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>5 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>⅓ cup whole roasted unsalted peanuts or cashews</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>

  <h4>Marinate the chicken:</h4>
    <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, dry sherry, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

  <h4>Prepare the sauce:</h4>
    <li>  In another medium bowl, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients until the cornstarch is dissolved (it can stick to the bottom of the bowl so be sure to scrape it up).</li>
  
  <h4>Heat a large nonstick skillet:</h4>
    <li>  Over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat. Add the bell pepper, celery, and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and set aside.</li>
  
  <h4>Add an additional ½ tablespoon of oil</h4>
    <li> To the pan and set over high heat. Add half of the chicken (it's important not to crowd the pan) and brown on one side, about 1½ minutes. Turn the chicken pieces and continue cooking for about 1½ minutes more, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Transfer the chicken to the bowl with the peppers and celery. Add another ½ tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the remaining chicken and cook until golden on one side, about 1½ minutes. Turn the chicken pieces over and cook for 1 minute. Add ½ tablespoon more oil to the pan, along with the garlic and scallions, and cook, stirring with the chicken, for about 30 seconds more.</li>

  <h4>Add the reserved vegetables and reserved chicken</h4>
    <li> To the pan, along with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken and vegetables are warmed through and the sauce is thickened, about 30 seconds. Stir in the nuts. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, and serve. (Note: the sauce will thicken as it sits; thin it with a few tablespoons of water, if necessary.)</li>
